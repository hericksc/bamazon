# bamazon

Welcome to my bamazon application. When you run bamazonCustomer.js file you will see a list of items in my inventory. The user can select the item they would like to purchase and then enter a quantity. The application will deduct that quantity from inventory. If you select more than what is available in the inventory the application will inform the customer that there is "insufficient quantity" to purchase. I provide a link to a demostration on how the application functions.
